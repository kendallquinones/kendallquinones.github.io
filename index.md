Imagine things you care about. 
Technology, Data, Customer Insights, Business and more, just without the complex jargon and buzzwords. 
You need the important, useful, actionable bits without the overcomplicated toppings. 
You expect practical examples, clear and concise explanations, specific use cases and evidence to back it all up.

You want to-the-point information, like having coffee with a friend that's telling it like it is. 

You want The Simple Version. I got you, stick around!
